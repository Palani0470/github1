STEPS TO CLONE A FILE FROM GITHUB AND EDIT IT IN LOCAL SYSTEM AND SAVE IT IN repository:
  1)open terminal in vscode
  2)enter the command "git clone https://github.com/Palani0470/github1.git"
  3)(https://github.com/Palani0470/github1.git)it is copied from github->repository->code->https
  4)to choose folder, enter this command "cd foldername" (cd github1)
  5).git folder act as bridge between github and our system.To view the .git folder follow step 6
  6)open my_git folder in system ->github1->view->show->hidden items
  7) after editing the file in local system enter the following  command in vscode terminal "git add intro.txt" where intro.txt is a file name.
  8)enter command "git status" to check the status of the file.
  9)Enter command 'git commit -m "file edited"
  10)enter command "git push origin main" to save the changes in github.
  11)now open the github repository and refresh it if needed to see the changes.

STEPS TO ADD A FILE OR FOLDER TO GITHUB WHICH WAS COMPLETLY CREATED IN LOCAL SYSTEM (NOT CLONED FROM GITHUB):

  1)create a folder in local system and create some files in the folder.If needed , change the path using"cd .." for backward change and "cd filename" for forward change.
  2)after creating the folder ,enter the command "git init".It is used to add .git file to the newly created folder which was created in local system.
  3)After editing the files use the command "git add ." for adding multiple files to staging area.If there is only one file use "git add filename".
  4)Next we need to Add commit message  'git commit -m "anymessage"'
  5)Now we need to add origin to our folder which was created in the system.For that use the command "git remote add origin https://github.com/Palani0470/github2.git".
  6)use command " git branch" to show all the branch in the repository.Initialy the branch name is named as master.
  7)Now we need to chance the name of the branch from master to main.For that use the command "git branch -m main".
  8)At last use the command "git push origin main" to save the files in github.
